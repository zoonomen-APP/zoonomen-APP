- 👋 Hi, I’m @zoonomen-APP
- 👀 I’m interested in Natural History, especially ornithology (nomenclatural bibliography and taxonomy) and the history of Lichen collecting in New England and in western North America
- 🌱 I’m currently creating an text file dataset of New England Lichen specimens based on the CNALH dataset.
-  I am standardizing the orthography of collector names, and using standardized orthography for county names and state names. This results in a large number of corrections
-  for dates of collection, names of collectors, and localities. Many records need reassignment of county, state, country (including specimens assigned to the wrong hemisphere).
-  Many dates can be corrected, or supplied when they are missing. Incorrect assignment of dates by century are common, due to date abbreviations on specimen labels.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
